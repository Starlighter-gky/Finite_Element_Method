# Finite Element Method for drive by exampleThis is a finite element program written by different language for different equation.### instruction - src The program source code   - doc document about the example, inclue the derivation of variational form for different equation, if there are many time for me, I will make the document in my wiki page.- each example is in one folder, so you don't worry about the include relation for different folder.- there are many example using dealii, fenics and ifem open source code, so many outstanding progrtam we need to lean.
