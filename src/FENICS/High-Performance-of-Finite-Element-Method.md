### This is the course of high performance of finite element method
#### 1.FEM in Science and Industry  
#### 2.Galerkin 1: Introducing FEM in an easy to understand setting without differential equations.  
#### 3.Galerkin 2: Expanding on FEM, now in the setting of partial differential equations. 
#### 4.Assemble: An automated methodology to construct the linear systems arising from FEM. 
#### 5.Non-linear 1: How to extend FEM to time-dependent and non-linear problems automatically. In part 1, time stepping methods will be introduced.  
#### 6.Non-linear 2: In part 2, the fixed-point iteration methodology for non-linear problems will be introduced.  
#### 7.Adaptivity: A goal-oriented duality-based adaptive error control methodology.
